				<h1> Hey, I'm Ridge Falco! </h1>
				
				<p> I've always been interested in computers, and I decided that programming was the next logical step in order to follow my dream of working with computers. So since high school I've started to flesh out my programming by learning different languages. </p>

			<h2> The Languages I've Learned so Far. </h2>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>Java Script</li>
				<li>The Basics of HTML</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4> I understand that I have a lot more to learn and I hope to add more languages to the list above as I grow. </h4>
			
			<p> I obtained my knowledge from a variety of courses and classes, like those offered at my high school, Perry Meridian, and programs I've taken over the summer. </p>
			
			<h2> Activities I've done to help further my tech career (in order). </h2>
			
			<ol>
				<li> Computer Science 1: Learned Python and some Java Script
				<li> Nextech: Learned HTML, more Java Script, and CSS
			</ol>
			
			<h4> I understand that education opportunities, big or small, can help me flesh out, not only my programming skills, but my soft skills and business skills. </h4>
			
			<p> When I'm not learning new languages or trying to get closer to reaching my goal of making a professional career in the tech world, I spend my free time on my hobbies. 
			
			<h2> My Hobbies. </h2> 

			<ul>
				<li>Learning about history.</li>
				<li>Playing games. My favorites being EU4, Skyrim, Fallout: New Vegas and The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</li>
				<li>Listening to political debates/podcasts.</li>
				<li>Hiking in parks, or walking around downtown.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h4> I try to use the free time I to better improve myself and to help myself learn even more.</h4>

			<p> I've also done some coding projects that I'm proud of.</p>

			<dl>
				<de> A game using motion controls:</de>
				<dd> The Game used a circuit board that had an accelerometer in it that allowed for the user to move a character on screen by tilting the board. I used this in order to create a small and short game to demonstrate that I could use the accelerometer. The game was coded in Java Script. </dd>
			</dl>

			<h4> I understand that completed projects are the best way to display my understanding and expertise in a given language and that I know how to apply the knowledge I've learned over the years. I hope to grow the catolouge of my achievements as the years go by.</h4>
