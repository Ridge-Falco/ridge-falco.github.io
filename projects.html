                    <de> A game using motion controls:</de>
                    <dd> The Game used a circuit board that had an accelerometer in it that allowed for the user to move a character on screen by tilting the board. I used this in order to create a small and short game to demonstrate that I could use the accelerometer. The game was coded in JavaScript. </dd>
                    <br>
                    <de> The Boomba Website:</de>
                    <dd> I worked with a group of four others to create a website for a fake product called "The Boomba." It was my first dive ever into programming with HTML and CSS. I did some of the fake customer reviews, like the New York Times one, and I did the front page.</dd>
                    <br>
                    <de> The Supremeifyer:</de>
                    <dd> A very simple website that will allow you to enter what ever you want, and will return the text in the supreme text. </dd>
